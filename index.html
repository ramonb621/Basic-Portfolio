            <p>My name is Ramon Barajas.  I grew up in a big community of Los Angeles called Boyle Heights during the 90's.  As a kid, I loved chasing after the ice cream man, playing Pokemon Yellow on my Gameboy, and watching cartoons.  As an adult my favorite pastimes aren't much different, but they include collecting action figures, watching the latest superhero flick, going to the gym, taking trips to the shooting range, going on hikes, and cooking.  Whether I'm relaxing at home or driving around I enjoy listening to a wide variety of music ranging from anything like jazz to folk music.  A random fact about me is that I have a huge soft spot for animals.  I actually have seven pets, two of which are dogs and the rest cats.  The dogs were rescued from a shelter and the cats picked up as kittens on the street.</p>
